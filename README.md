# Particles
Classic “connecting dots” / constellation effect. HTML5 &lt;canvas> + JavaScript animation loop.

Customed background with start shaped particles that spin and make connection with near by stars. The cursor acts as a block hole and sucks in the stars. There are small while dots to represent far off galaxies.
